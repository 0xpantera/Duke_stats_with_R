# Duke University Statistics with R

![Duke University Logo] (https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6d/3cb3e06c357d40ef60000fb3d12d72/dukesquare_blue.png?auto=format&dpr=1&w=&h=72)

In this Specialization, you will learn to analyze and visualize data in R and created reproducible data analysis reports, demonstrate a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference, perform frequentist and Bayesian statistical inference and modeling to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions, communicate statistical results correctly, effectively, and in context without relying on statistical jargon, critique data-based claims and evaluated data-based decisions, and wrangle and visualize data with R packages for data analysis.

You will produce a portfolio of data analysis projects from the Specialization that demonstrates mastery of statistical data analysis from exploratory analysis to inference to modeling, suitable for applying for statistical analysis or data scientist positions.
